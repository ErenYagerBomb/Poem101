New beginings come with an end.
A chapters beauty is in the discovery.
Pre destined words which can be changed.
Some good, some bad.
But that's what goes into a best selling novel.

Each novel is not for everyone.
Unquie in it's wisdom.
There's on for everyone.

You may be at the beggining middle or end of your novel.
Pondering between the chapters.
Some mysterys will never be answered.
Until the author retunrs to the novel.
