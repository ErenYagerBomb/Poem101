New beginnings come with an end.
A chapter's beauty is in the discovery.
Pre-destined words can be changed.
Some good, some bad.
But that's what goes into a best-selling novel.

Each novel is not for everyone.
Unquie in its wisdom.
There's one for everyone.

You may be at the beginning middle or end of your novel.
Pondering between the chapters.
Some mysteries will never be answered.
Until the author explains the novel.
